# Job-Finder
A program that uses web scraping to search websites for jobs. Currently hard-coding it to Linkedin and for computer science related jobs. Using Beautifulsoup and python to do the web scraping. I plan on adding more websites and to expand the search to include any jobs. Also plan on turning the program into a desktop application.
